# E-Commerce Back End

## Description

The challenge was to program the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. I configured a working Express.js API and used Sequelize models that interact with a MySQL database. I programmed GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes that perform CRUD operations. The user is able to view categories, products, and tags. The user is also able to create new entries (category, product or tag), edit, and delete entries using Insomnia. 


## Installation

To use the e-commerce application, you will need to install express.js, dotenv, mysql12, sequelize, and insomnia.


## Usage

The video below demonstrates the e-commerce application's functionality.

## Contributing

I am responsible for refactoring the starter code for this project. The starter code was provided by edX Bootcamp.
